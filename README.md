### 💡 Beyond the Prototype  
VioPulse is my solo lab for building AI tools, automations, and systems that turn raw ideas into smooth, scalable, and functional prototypes that just work.
I'm a systems-oriented tinkerer who bridges the gap between brilliant ideas and scalable realities.  
I specialize in **AI tooling**, **complex automation**, and **product-sense**, delivering performant solutions that *just work.*

## 🧠 Core Work  

### 🛰️ **DAAN DAAN Traffic Sim**  
A **Python + Streamlit** web app using **OSMnx**, **NetworkX**, and **GeoPandas** to simulate **Braess’ Paradox** and identify optimal road closures in Metro Manila.  
**Key Tech:** `Python` · `Streamlit` · `Data Visualization` · `Graph Theory`  

#### Features  
- Automated network acquisition from OpenStreetMap  
- Iterative closure simulations for each road segment  
- Parametric flexibility for trips and congestion settings  
- Interactive visualization with Folium maps  
- “Winners vs Losers” breakdown to analyze road impacts  

📄 *Result:* Validated 100% true positive detection rate under simulated high-congestion scenarios.
